# C++
C++ basic code using if condition, setw, setfill, setprecision, scientific and more.

1. Create three constants as follows:
 Theater’s percentage with value 0.195
 Adult ticket price with value 10.5
 Child ticket price with value ඥ𝑎𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒. You must use the 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡 function from the 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ library.
2. Prompt the user to enter a movie 𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒. If the movie name consists of fewer than 5 characters, print a message and
terminate the program. See Figure 1.
3. Prompt the user to enter the number of 𝑎𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡 tickets sold. If the number is 0 or negative, print a message and
terminate the program. See Figure 2.
4. Prompt the user to enter the number of 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 tickets sold. If the number is 0 or negative, print a message and
terminate the program. See Figure 3.
5. Compute the gross profit: ሺ#𝑎𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 ൈ 𝑎𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒ሻ ൅ ሺ#𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 ൈ 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒ሻ
6. Compute net profit: 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 ൈ 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟ᇱ
𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒
7. Compute savings: 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 െ 𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡
8. Display the formatted results as shown in Figure 4:
 Must use 𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 to display the 50 equal signs (^). Do 𝑁𝑂𝑇 type 50 consecutive ^’s.
 Each label column is a column of 22 characters.
 Value column is using precision 3 and scientific notation
 Note that you must print the double quotes around the movie’s name and the $ for the last three values.
 Use the following input lines for testing:
